## Contributions
Please list who did what for each part of the project, and if anyone [pair programmed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) in this section.

Roman: Started webScraper.rb. Used nokogiri gem to parse/grab Title of articles and links to webpage. Wrote functions for grabbing elements 
and printing them in HTML format.

Tom:

Zach: Played with launchy gem to try and have the program automatically open the html file. It was later decided to have the user open it instead. Wrote code to have all of the html structure be written to a separate file. Organized code once complete so our main file (webScraper.rb) was as clean as possible. Move all functions in the program to their own respective files.
